8-8-2018 collabration with Rachel and Sonam 
cards won't toggle now app.js:47 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'contains' of undefined
we do not understand why in Sandra's walkthrough is has 'disable' in her code 

8/9/2018 worked with Rachel Bon my matches, modified the HTML and took out the open, show and matched so that cards would not start. reviewed Sandra's walkthrough and code, and have some questions about the discard 

8/11/2018 worked with Gina Ruark on my shuffle function 
Started the psuedo code for starting my game 
need to define the function clearGame, amd modfiy the shuffle array that Udacity provided 
During the co-hort meetup on saturday Julie clarified why I need to have the disable in my code.
disable makes it so that the cards can not be flipped back over once they are matched so that is why in Sandra's walkthrough she has disabled

8/13/2018 added match function but now my cards will not flip again at least the anchor
trying to figure out how to read the DOM
It is showing that I have the leaf open and it is showing anchor as open,show
really need to get better at Dom manipulation
